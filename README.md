## Personal NeoVim-Configuration
This is my personal NeoVim-Configuration which is mainly optimized for being used in Typescript, HTML, CSS and for Java Development (e. g. when using gradle projects).

# IMPORTANT
When you are also using the onedark theme, you should consider sourcing the java and typescript files in your main syntax files for a better look and feel.
